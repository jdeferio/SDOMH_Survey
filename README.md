# SDOMH_Survey
Social Determinants of Mental Health Collection Survey
-----------------------------------

The purpose of the survey is to elicit from patients, in a structured and easily-deployable manner, information about experiences with depression/mental illness and how one’s particular social (physical and digital) and, environmental conditions may or may not influence their mental health. We aim to use these results to design future observational and prospective studies that link individual-level SDOH data to other data sources (i.e., electronic health records).

The survey was constructed using questions from several existing instruments, such as the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients’ Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) tool, designed to measure SDOH as well as structural and attitudinal barriers to healthcare.(1,2)
